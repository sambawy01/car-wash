 * Eco's tool belt.
 *
 * Two classes of tools:
 * - READ-ONLY (bookings_*, orders_list, order_lookup, catalog_list,
 *   stats_summary, client_history, daily_brief, document_create) execute
 *   immediately inside the agent loop.
 * - MUTATING (booking_confirm/decline/move, order_set_status,
 *   product_update/add/remove, block_time, email_send to non-owner
 *   recipients) are NEVER executed by the model directly. The agent loop
 *   intercepts them, stores a pending action on Blob, and the owner gets a
 *   [Confirm | Cancel] inline keyboard. Only the callback handler calls
 *   `executeTool` for these. Every confirmation summary spells out the
 *   third-party side effects (client emails, public-site changes, calendar
 *   blocking) — see `describeMutation`, which builds the summary
 *   structurally so disclosure cannot depend on the model's mood.
 *
 * `document_create` sends the PDF straight to the owner chat — it creates
 *   nothing outside Telegram, so it counts as read-only.
