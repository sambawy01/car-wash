/**
 * Shared data gathering for the daily brief — used by both the
 * 8am-Cairo cron email (/api/cron/daily-brief) and Eco's `daily_brief`
 * Telegram tool, so the two views can never drift.
 *
 * Fail-soft per source: if Cal or Blob is down, the brief still renders with
 * a "couldn't load X" note instead of failing entirely. The CRM re-booking
 * radar is additive — a failure there only drops the "due for a check-in"
 * section, never the rest of the brief.
 *
 * The re-booking radar builds the WHOLE CRM directory (an extra Cal + Blob
 * scan). Callers that don't render it — the evening digest discards
 * `rebookingDue` — pass `{ includeRebooking: false }` to skip that work
 * entirely rather than build a directory only to throw it away.
